Steps I did:
1. Opened https://notebooklm.google and signed in with my Gmail.
2. Created a new notebook.
3. Uploaded BUS5CA lecture slides (PDF) and one journal article.
4. Asked: “Summarise key reasons for customer churn.”
5. Used the Briefing Doc and Audio Overview to review.
6. Checked Discover Sources suggestions.

Observations:
- Summaries were mostly accurate and easy to understand.
- Missed a few numeric details and examples.
- Audio overview was helpful for revision.
- Privacy concern if uploading assignment files.

Conclusion:
NotebookLM is very useful for summarising study notes and revision, but should be used carefully for academic accuracy.
